Key questions
* How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
* Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
* How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends?

Key takeaway from the dataset
- Senior men dominate electronic purchases: Electronic purchases among seniors increased by 10%, with 75% of the revenue coming from men, who buy in larger quantities and at higher prices. However, sales decline at the end of the year.
- Differences in clothing consumption by gender and age: Women aged 18-30 and 61+ spend more on clothing than men. In contrast, men 18-30 buy more clothing but at lower prices, while those 61+ buy less and at lower prices.
- 31-45 age group purchases drop significantly in summer: This age group bought significantly less in July, August, and September compared to the rest of the year.
- Differences in beauty product purchases for 46-60 age group: Women in this age range buy more beauty products but at lower prices. In contrast, men buy fewer beauty products overall but tend to choose higher-priced items when they do purchase.

Recommendations
1. Boost Electronics Sales Among Seniors (61+)
Bundle high-end electronics with services (e.g., installation, extended warranties) to appeal to men who prioritize quality and durability.
Launch pre-holiday promotions (October–November) to counteract the year-end sales decline.

2. Improve Clothing Sales by Targeting Key Demographics
Women 61+: Introduce a senior-focused clothing line that balances comfort and style, promoted through loyalty programs.
Men 18–30: Offer a subscription service for affordable basics (e.g., monthly T-shirt packs) to match their frequent, low-cost purchasing habits.

3. Capture More Beauty Product Sales (46–60-Year-Old Women)
Introduce a mid-tier beauty product line that provides affordable anti-aging and skincare solutions.
Encourage bulk purchases with "Buy More, Save More" deals.

4. Reignite Spending Among 31–45-Year-Olds (Especially in Summer)
Offer seasonal flash sales in July–September to counteract the spending slump.
Conduct customer surveys to understand key financial constraints and adjust marketing accordingly
